      "explanation": "Page 4 provides the key equation for this common redox titration: 2S₂O₃²⁻(aq) + I₂(aq) → S₄O₆²⁻(aq) + 2I⁻(aq). The product is the tetrathionate ion."

      },
      "answer": "B",
      "explanation": "In the reaction on page 4, carbon is oxidized (from 0 to +4 in CO₂) and sulfur in H₂SO₄ is reduced (from +6 to +4 in SO₂). This confirms H₂SO₄ is acting as an oxidizing agent. Option A is dilute acid, C is neutralization, and D shows its dehydrating property."

      "explanation": "Page 2 shows that CO₂ reacts with bases. After forming sodium carbonate (Na₂CO₃), passing more CO₂ through the solution produces sodium hydrogencarbonate (also known as sodium bicarbonate): Na₂CO₃(aq) + CO₂(g) + H₂O(l) → 2NaHCO₃(aq)."

      "answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Page 6 shows that AsCl₃ hydrolyzes completely to form arsenous acid (H₃AsO₃). Further down Group 15, SbCl₃ and BiCl₃ undergo partial hydrolysis to form the white precipitates of antimony oxychloride (SbOCl) and bismuth oxychloride (BiOCl).

      "answer": "C",
      "explanation": "While typically a base, ammonia can act as a very weak acid. In its reaction with a highly reactive metal like sodium (under anhydrous liquid ammonia conditions), it donates a proton to form the amide ion (NH₂⁻) and hydrogen gas. This is listed under 'As an oxidizing agent/acid (dry conditions)' on page 7."

      "options": {
        "A": "MgO: neutral pH; Al₂O₃: acidic pH; P₄O₁₀: basic pH",

        "D": "All three would produce a neutral pH as they are oxides, not acids or bases."
      },
      "answer": "B",
      "explanation": "This question tests the reaction of Period 3 oxides with water. MgO is a basic oxide and forms Mg(OH)₂, a sparingly soluble base, raising the pH. Al₂O₃ is amphoteric and effectively insoluble in water, so it won't change the pH significantly. P₄O₁₀ is a strongly acidic oxide that reacts vigorously with water to form phosphoric acid (H₃PO₄), causing a large drop in pH. (Concepts from Page 1 & 2)."

      },
      "answer": "C",
      "explanation": "This is a two-part deduction. First, the reaction with magnesium (2Mg + SO₂ → 2MgO + S) shows SO₂ acting as an oxidizing agent, producing white magnesium oxide and yellow elemental sulfur. Second, the reaction with KMnO₄ (5SO₂ + 2KMnO₄ + 2H₂O → K₂SO₄ + 2MnSO₄ + 2H₂SO₄) shows SO₂ acting as a reducing agent. SO₂ is unique in the notes for showing both these properties clearly.

        "A": "Only nitric acid can oxidize sulfur; sulfuric acid is just a dehydrating agent.",
        "B": "Both reactions produce SO₂, but nitric acid also produces H₂O.",
        "C": "Nitric acid produces nitrogen dioxide (NO₂) as its reduction product, while sulfuric acid produces sulfur dioxide (SO₂) as its reduction product.",
        "D": "Nitric acid produces N₂ gas, while sulfuric acid produces H₂S gas."
      },
      "answer": "C",
      "explanation": "This question requires comparing two different strong oxidizing acids. From page 3: S(s) + 6HNO₃(l) → H₂SO₄(l) + 6NO₂(g) + 2H₂O(l). From page 4: S(s) + 2H₂SO₄(l) → 3SO₂(g) + 2H₂O(l). In both cases, sulfur is oxidized to a higher oxidation state (+4 or +6). The key difference is the reduction product of the acid itself: HNO₃ is reduced to NO₂, while H₂SO₄ is reduced to SO₂."

        "C": "Aluminum (Al)",
        "D": "Silicon (Si)"
      },
      "answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Let's analyze the clues. 'Fuming liquid' suggests a volatile covalent chloride. 'Hydrolyzes completely' points away from ionic NaCl/MgCl₂. 'White solid precipitate' is the key. The hydrolysis of SiCl₄ (SiCl₄ + 2H₂O → SiO₂ + 4HCl) produces solid silicon dioxide (SiO₂) and strong acid (HCl), which explains the pH of 1. AlCl₃ hydrolysis is complex and gives a clear acidic solution, not a distinct white precipitate in this manner. (Concepts from Page 5)."

      "question": "Why is HF considered a weak acid in aqueous solution, while HCl, HBr, and HI are strong acids?",
      "options": {
        "A": "The extensive hydrogen bonding in HF prevents it from dissolving in water.",
        "B": "Fluorine is less electronegative than Cl, Br, and I, making the H-F bond less polar.",
        "C": "The H-F bond dissociation energy is exceptionally high, making it difficult for the molecule to ionize.",
        "D": "HF is a much larger molecule than HCl, HBr, and HI."
      },
      "answer": "C",
      "explanation": "This is a classic question that distinguishes between two properties. Hydrogen bonding (Option A) explains HF's high boiling point, not its acid strength. The primary reason for its weakness as an acid is the very strong covalent bond between H and F, which has a high bond dissociation energy. More energy is required to break this bond to release H⁺ compared to the other hydrogen halides. (Concept from Page 4)."

        "D": "It is a gas that does not react with water."
      },
      "answer": "B",
      "explanation": "First, identify element Y. An oxide that reacts with both acid and base is amphoteric. In Period 3, this is Al₂O₃, so Y is Aluminum. Now, consider the chloride of Y, which is AlCl₃. According to the table on page 5, AlCl₃ has covalent character and its aqueous solution is acidic due to hydrolysis: [Al(H₂O)₆]³⁺(aq) ⇌ [Al(H₂O)₅OH]²⁺(aq) + H⁺(aq). It exists as a solid, Al₂Cl₆ dimer, but the description of its solution behavior is what's being tested. (Links concepts from Page 1 and 5)."

        "D": "React chlorine gas with water at room temperature."
      },
      "answer": "B",
      "explanation": "The products of the disproportionation of chlorine depend on the conditions. Page 7 shows that cold, dilute NaOH produces NaCl and NaOCl (sodium hypochlorite, or chlorate(I)). To get the higher oxidation state chlorate(V) (NaClO₃), hot (above 80°C), concentrated NaOH must be used: 3Cl₂ + 6NaOH → 5NaCl + NaClO₃ + 3H₂O."

        "D": "React sodium amide (NaNH₂) with chlorine gas."
      },
      "answer": "B",
      "explanation": "The outcome of the reaction between ammonia and chlorine depends entirely on which reactant is in excess. Page 7 shows two possibilities. With excess ammonia, the product is N₂ gas. To produce the hazardous NCl₃, ammonia must be the limiting reagent and reacted with excess chlorine: NH₃(g) + 3Cl₂(g) → NCl₃(l) + 3HCl(g)."

      },
      "answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Sodium thiosulfate solution contains the S₂O₃²⁻ ion. In acidic conditions, thiosulfuric acid (H₂S₂O₃) is formed, which is unstable and immediately decomposes. Page 4 gives the decomposition: H₂S₂O₃(aq) → S(s) + SO₂(g) + H₂O(l). The solid sulfur (S) is a fine yellow precipitate that makes the solution cloudy, and the gas evolved is sulfur dioxide (SO₂), which has a sharp, choking smell."

        "D": "Al₂O₃(aq), which is a dissolved form of the amphoteric oxide."
      },
      "answer": "B",
      "explanation": "In aqueous solution, the small, highly charged Al³⁺ ion is hydrated by six water molecules, forming the hexaquaaluminum(III) complex ion, [Al(H₂O)₆]³⁺. This complex ion is acidic because the high charge density on the Al³⁺ polarizes the O-H bonds in the surrounding water ligands, making it easier for a proton (H⁺) to be released. This is mentioned on Page 6 and explains why AlCl₃ solution is acidic on Page 5."
